## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Nothing new in this project. It's everything i have come acrossed before. The layout challenge in this project was very interesting though and i found a way to change svg color in img.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.footer-section > div > ul > li:hover > a > img {
  filter: invert(0.21) sepia(1) saturate(7) hue-rotate(302.4deg) brightness(0.86);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue to make layouts for more compplex designs.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/the-many-ways-to-change-an-svg-fill-on-hover-and-when-to-use-them/#:~:text=Target%20the%20.,hover%20state%20to%20swap%20colors.&text=This%20is%20by%20far%20the,hover%20state%20to%20an%20SVG.) - this helps to change your svg to the color you want.
